# Note
This is a screenshot of my final overal grade for this course. I am very proud of the 99.88% I recieved in such a class that many of my classmates
thought was very tough. I personally put a lot of hard work in, however, I felt that data structures and algorithms came naturally to me
so I did not struggle.
